# Description
A full web application tailored specifically for software developers, offering a social media experience with features like discussion initiation and interactive reactions such as liking or commenting. Each user can personalize their profile with education and work history, along with links to other social media profiles and the option to showcase their GitHub repositories. Powered by the MERN stack, our frontend relies on React with Redux for efficient state management. MongoDB serves as the reliable data hub, securely storing user information until account deletion. Meanwhile, on the backend, Node.js and Express smoothly handle requests, ensuring seamless communication with MongoDB for data retrieval."
